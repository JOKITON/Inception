Project of 42 School, made using Docker-Compose version 2.xx

- Three (3) services:
 - Nginx
 - Wordpress & php-fpm
 - MariaDB

- Other dependencies:
 - image : alpine:3.18.6

-Warning-
- The project was made using my login 'jaizpuru' as part of a fixed path to set up necessary volumes,
  change the path accordingly in both 'docker-compose.yml' & 'Makefile'.

-Commits-
Some commits do not have any useful content, since I made a lot of different configuration changes in the master branch instead of creating a brand new one for testing.

-Progress-
If you see any configuration misplaced, any unused package, ... I am open to pull requests, changes, reviews, ...
